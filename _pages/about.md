I am a postdoc at [University of Massachusetts - Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), working with [Don Towsley](https://www-net.cs.umass.edu/personnel/towsley.html) and [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/).
I received my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) under the guidance of [John C.S. Lui](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/).

My research is dedicated to the following three directions:
